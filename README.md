# Tideman
Gives the winner in a group of candidates through the Tideman voting system.


Each voter votes for 3 candidates, and ranks them based on preference. For example, if the Candidates are Alice, Charlie, and Bob, a voter could rank Charlie first, Bob second, and Alice third. Or any combination of the three, then the code needs to use that information to obtain the winner. More details on the instructions and how it works can be found here --> https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/3/tideman/. I could not figure out how to write the lock pairs function and check for cycles in candidate graphs.
